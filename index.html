              <h4>Step 1: Make the Rice</h4>
              <p>Fried rice requires cool, non-sticky rice, so it's best to use rice leftover from takeout or the night before, but if you didn't plan ahead, then make sure the rice you cook crumbles apart and doesn't stick together. Here's my method: In a pot on the stove, combined 1 & 1/4 cups water with a splash of olive oil and salt. Cover and bring to a boil, then add in 1 cup of white rice, stirring together before covering again and reducing to the lowest heat (there should still be a tiny flame though). Set a timer for 18 minutes. (At this point, you should start on everything else.) After 18-20 minutes, remove the rice from the burner and set aside for ten minutes with the lid still on. Then remove the lid and fluff the rice.</p>
              <h4>Step 2: Make the Meat</h4>
              <p>Your vegetables should already be chopped before starting on the meat. If you're cooking this in a wok, add an oil with a high smoking point (so not olive) to the wok and bring to a high heat. Wok cooking gets very hot, so watch the flame and don't set off the smoke alarm. Swish the oil around so that is covers the sides of the wok as well, and then, once it's hot, add some chopped onion to the oil. After a minute, add some garlic. Once the onion has turned transparent, add in your meat. Add pepper and just a little salt to your meat and then break it up into tiny chunks.</p>
              <h4>Step 3: Add the Vegetables</h4>
              <p>Push your cooked meat up to the sides of the wok, allowing its fat to pool in the center. Add in some more of your high-smoke-point oil and then throw in your vegetables. Season them with a little onion or garlic salt and some pepper. If you have a lot of vegetables, you might want to do them in little batches, pushing them to the side of the wok when you're done and then adding more. If you're not a fan of cooking with that much fat, you can always drain it, but be careful, it's hot!</p>
              <h4>Step 4: Make Your Eggs</h4>
              <p>While the vegetables are cooking, make your scrambled eggs. For one cup of rice, 5 or 6 eggs is usually pretty good. Stir up those little eggs with some salt and pepper and cook in a separate little pan on the stove. Don't let them burn!</p>
              <h4>Step 5: Add in Your Rice</h4>
              <p>By now, the rice should be fluffed. Push the vegetables and meat to the side of the wok and add a little more oil in the center, then add your rice. Cook only for a little bit because on high heat the rice will stick to the wok quickly, so you should be stirring the rice in the center.</p>
              <h4>Step 6: Add in Your Eggs</h4>
              <p>Add your eggs in!</p>
              <h4>Step 7: Bring It All Together</h4>
              <p>Pour in about three tablespoons of soy sauce and then stir it all together! Add a splash of toasted sesame oil (if you have it) and then season with garlic or onion salt to taste.</p>
              <h4>Step 8: Serve</h4>
              <p>If you're a fan of some heat, top with sriracha, and if you've got sesame seeds, add a dash on top. That's your meal!</p>
