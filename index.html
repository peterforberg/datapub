                <h1>I am not a chef</h1>
                <p>I don't have a long history with food, aside from its life-sustaining attributes. For most of my life, I never had to prepare food for myself beyond my daily lunches (which for about 10 years consisted of a PB&J, apple sauce, and some cookies) and the occassional breakfast. My mother always cooked for us, and because she <i>did</i> have to cook for herself as a child, she was actually pretty good at it. In fact, between her time working at a Chinese restaurant and a pizzeria, she had become quite the accomplished chef, even on our family's limited budget.</p>
                <p>Now that I live on my own, I've had to pick up some of her skills. I really enjoy cooking, and I think it's a good way to unwind after a long day of work (or a nice break in the midst of work). I like to treat cooking as an activity and give it time. While I'm a fairly busy person, I'll make time for cooking because I think it's a disservice to both the ingredients and my body if I just fly through a recipe absentmindedly.</p>
                <p>Anyways, this site has some recipes and pictures of things that I've cooked recently. I don't often photograph my food, and it's never to be artistic, so these are poor quality photos but high quality recipes. The reason I put this site together is because my original idea was to try and remake one of my favorite site on the web, <a href="http://allaboutfrogs.org/">All About Frogs,</a> but that started taking too long, and I spent way too much time browsing its various fun pages. I hope those parts of the internet are preserved for as long as possible.</p>
